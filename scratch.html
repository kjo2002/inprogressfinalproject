        The Portland Thorns FC, one of the most successful teams in women’s soccer, was established in 2012 as a founding member of the National Women’s 
        Soccer League (NWSL). Owned by Peregrine Sports, the same group that owns the Portland Timbers, the Thorns quickly became a cornerstone of women’s 
        professional soccer in the United States. The team played its inaugural season in 2013 at Providence Park in Portland, Oregon, and immediately set 
        a high standard by winning the league's first championship. Renowned for their passionate fanbase, the Thorns regularly draw some of the highest 
        attendance numbers in women’s club soccer globally. Over the years, the club has earned multiple NWSL Championships and the NWSL Shield, 
        establishing a legacy of excellence. They have also been home to many of the world’s top players, including U.S. Women's National Team stars like 
        Christine Sinclair, Tobin Heath, and Lindsey Horan. The Thorns' history is marked by a commitment to advancing women’s soccer and fostering a 
        vibrant sports culture in Portland.<br>

        The Portland Thorns FC have featured some of the most notable players in women's soccer history. Christine Sinclair, the all-time leading
        international goal scorer, has been a foundational figure for the team since its beginning, serving as a leader both on and off the field. U.S. 
        Women's National Team stars like Tobin Heath, known for her flair and technical ability, and Lindsey Horan, a dynamic midfielder, have been key 
        contributors to the Thorns' success. Alex Morgan, another prominent U.S. star, played for the Thorns early in her career, helping to establish 
        the team's competitive edge. International talents have also made their mark, with Australia’s Sam Kerr bringing her goal-scoring prowess to the 
        team and Crystal Dunn adding versatility and strength. These players, alongside a host of other stars, have helped make the Thorns one of the most 
        successful and influential clubs in women’s soccer.<br><br>

        <img src="assets/img/thorns 24.jpeg" height="150"> <br><br>
        The Portland Thorns FC had a strong 2023-2024 season, showcasing their continued dominance in the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL). Under 
        the leadership of head coach Mike Norris, the team demonstrated resilience and skill, securing a playoff spot with impressive performances 
        throughout the year. Key players like Christine Sinclair and Lindsey Horan provided leadership, while younger talents like Olivia Moultrie and 
        Sophia Smith played pivotal roles in the attack. The Thorns’ defense, led by stalwart goalkeeper Bella Bixby and solid defenders like Becky 
        Sauerbrunn, remained tough to break down. Throughout the season, the Thorns built on their winning culture, maintaining a competitive edge and 
        showing their ability to contend with the league’s best teams. Although they faced tough competition in the playoffs, their consistency and 
        teamwork were clear throughout the campaign, reinforcing Portland’s position as one of the top clubs in the NWSL.<br>
